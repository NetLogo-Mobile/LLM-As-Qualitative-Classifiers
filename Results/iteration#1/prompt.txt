The name of the practice is 'Computational Modeling and Simulation Practices', which is consisted of subpractices includes 
'Using computational models to understand a phenomenon',
'Using computational models to hypothesize and test predictions',
'Using a computational tool to understand a system's compenents and dynamics',
'Using a model to understand how positive and negative feedback function and impact a system',
'Assessing computational models',
'Modifying a computational model to better fit a phenomenon',
'Designing and constructing computational models.
 
Determine whether the following 10 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

1: What is the parameter of interest? What symbol is used to represent this value?
2: What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?
3: How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?
4: What is the parameter of interest for this situation?
5: What statistic are we using to estimate the parameter of interest for this situation?
6: Do you think taking a sample this size from this population effectively estimates the mean score of the population?
7: Calculate the sample mean for all possible samples of size 2 from this population. 
8: Create a dotplot of your results from question #2. Create your sketch below.
9: In most real-life situations, we cannot create the dotplot of all possible samples of size n from the entire population (size N). Why not?
10: Click "setup" and then "collect sample". What did the model do?
